# # Sensitivity analysis of the anthropogenic mass definition
# 
# In this study, anthropogenic mass is defined as the mass embedded in inanimate solid objects made by humans, that were not yet demolished or taken out of service. This definition is supported by the scientific field of industrial ecology and used by bureaus of statistics. Other definitions can be proposed. Here we present their calculations.

# ## Include mass of crops and agroforestry under anthropogenic mass instead of under biomass
# 
# To calculate the mass of crops and agroforestry (i.e., trees integrated in agricultural settings/landscapes), we mostly relied on the work by [Zomer et al.](http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/srep29987). We first estimated the area of the agricultural land, and then multiplied it by the corresponding biomass density
# 
# To derive the agriculture area since 1900, we use the 2000 area estimate by [Zomer et al., 2016](http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/srep29987) and as an approximation, assume it behaves similarly to the cropland area.
# The cropland area estimates were obtained from [Goldewijk et al., 2017](http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/essd-9-927-2017) (Table S3), HYDE 3.2.

agr_area.iloc[:,1] = agr_area.iloc[:,1]* 1e8 


# Next, we derive the trend in the mass density between 2000-2010, using the two corresponding estimates by [Zomer et al.](http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/srep29987):

# Calculate the linear density trend 
den_trend = np.polyfit(agr_den.iloc[:,0],agr_den.iloc[:,1], 1)[0]

# To estimate the stock of anthropogenic CO<sub>2</sub> mass over the studied period, we subtracted the pre-industrial CO<sub>2</sub> mass from the annual mean CO<sub>2</sub> stocks since 1900. 
# 
# Annual atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations from 1959-2019 were obtained from [NOAA/ESRL](https://www.esrl.noaa.gov/gmd/ccgg/trends/) (Dr. Pieter Tans; Mauna Loa Observatory, Hawaii) and the [Scripps Institution of Oceanography](https://scrippsco2.ucsd.edu) (Dr. Ralph Keeling).

# We then convert the concentration estimates to mass stocks of Gigatonnes CO<sub>2</sub>. This is done by first using a conversion factor from ppm CO<sub>2</sub> to Gigatonnes C, obtained from [Friedlingstein et al., 2019](http://doi.org/10.5194/essd-11-1783-2019). Later we convert to Gigatonnes CO<sub>2</sub> by multiplying by the ratio of the molecular weights:

# We now subtract the CO<sub>2</sub> pre-industrial stocks, which derived based on the [IPCC](https://archive.ipcc.ch/ipccreports/tar/wg1/016.htm) concentration estimate of about 280 ppm.

# In[20]:

# ## Add civil engineering earthworks, dredging and waste/overburden from metal and mineral production to the anthropogenic mass 
# 
# The anthropogenic mass definition is composed only of the current in-use human-made mass. In addition to this mass, humanity moves and extracts material not intended for usage, for example, waste or overburden from mineral extraction, civil engineering excavations and dredging.
# 
# Our estimation for the yearly addition resulting of these actions is mostly based on a recent study by [Cooper et al. 2018](http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/2053019618800234), with updates to complement our anthropogenic mass estimation and avoid double counting. We include four groups: dredging, civil engineering earthworks, waste/ overburden resulted from mineral/metal or coal production.

# ### dredging 
# The mass associated with dredging, since 1925, was obtained from [Cooper et al.](http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/2053019618800234), SI table1.

# In[22]:


# Upload dredging data from Cooper et al., units [Mt/y]
dredging = pd.read_excel("excavations_Cooper.xlsx").iloc[:,[0,1]]

# Convert to units of Teratonnes/year
dredging['dredging'] = dredging.iloc[:,1]/1e6


# We then extrapolate the estimate from 1925 till 1900, based on the first five years, assuming exponential growth.

# In[23]:


# Extrapolate the estimate from 1925 till 1900, based on the first five years, assuming exponential growth
factor = (dredging.shift(-1).iloc[:5, 1] / dredging.iloc[:5, 1]).mean()
dredging = pd.DataFrame({'Year': xrange(1900, 2016),'dredging': [dredging.iloc[0, 1] / (factor ** i) for i in range(26)][::-1] + list(dredging.iloc[1:, 1])}, columns = ['Year', 'dredging'])


# ### waste/ overburden from coal production 
# The waste/ overburden from coal production were adopted from [Cooper et al.](http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/2053019618800234), SI table1.

# In[24]:


# Upload waste/ overburden from coal production data from Cooper et al. SI table1, units [Mt/y]
coal_over = pd.read_excel("excavations_Cooper.xlsx").iloc[:,[0,2]]

# Convert to units of Teratonnes/year
coal_over['overburden/ waste\nfrom coal production'] = coal_over.iloc[:,1]/1e6


# In[25]:


# Extrapolate the estimate from 1925 till 1900, based on the first five years, assuming exponential growth
factor = (coal_over.shift(-1).iloc[:5, 1] / coal_over.iloc[:5, 1]).mean()
coal_over = pd.DataFrame({'Year': xrange(1900, 2016),'overburden/ waste\nfrom coal production': [coal_over.iloc[0, 1] / (factor ** i) for i in range(26)][::-1] + list(coal_over.iloc[1:, 1])}, columns = ['Year', 'overburden/ waste\nfrom coal production'])


# ### civil engineering earthworks
# 
# The mass of civil engineering earthworks was derived by multiplying the mass of used cement and aggregates by a factor of 2, following the approach presented in [Cooper et al.](http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/2053019618800234). 
# 
# To estimate the mass of cement and aggregates used each year, we first calculate the net addition to stocks for the aggregates, concrete and asphalt categories. Asphalt values were multiplied by 0.95 to represent the fraction of aggregates.

# In[26]:


# Calculating the yearly net additions to stocks for the aggregates and concrete and asphalt categories 
nas = (anthropogenic_mass.iloc[:,[1,2]] - anthropogenic_mass.shift(1).iloc[:,[1,2]])
asphalt = 0.95*(anthropogenic_mass.iloc[:,[4]] - anthropogenic_mass.shift(1).iloc[:,[4]])

# Summing all additions
nas = (nas.sum(axis=1) + np.array(list(asphalt.iloc[:,0]))).fillna(0)


# To approximate the mass of aggregates and cement used each year, we add to the yearly net additions to stocks the yearly waste of these categories.
# The waste here includes the end-of-life, construction and re-manufacturing wastes, in addition recycling is considered in the calculation. Thus the approximation of the used cement and aggregates might be slightly high.

# In[27]:


# Upload the annual waste of the aggregates, concrete and asphalt categories, units [Gigatonnes/t] 
waste = pd.read_excel("waste_Wiedenhofer.xlsx")

# Sum the waste flows, converted to Teratonnes/year
waste = waste.iloc[:,1:4].sum(axis=1)/1000 + np.array(list(waste.iloc[:,4]*0.95))/1000


# We then multiplied the outcome by a factor of 2, to obtain the annual mass of earthwork. 

# In[28]:


earthwork = 2 * (nas[:100] + waste[:100])


# ### waste/overburden resulted from mineral/metal production
# To estimate the amount of waste/overburden resulted from mineral/metal production, we used [Cooper et al.](http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/2053019618800234) values, which combined the mineral/metal production and the associated waste/overburden. 
# 
# To avoid double counting, we interpolated their mineral/metal production for all years (using the provided estimates for selected years), based on exponential fit.

# In[29]:


# Upload waste/overburden resulted from mineral/metal production from Cooper et al., units [Mt/y]
m_over = pd.read_excel("excavations_Cooper.xlsx").iloc[:,[0,3]]
m_over.head()


# To avoid double counting with our anthropogenic mass estimate, we subtracted from this combined estimate the mineral/metal production. 
# This was performed by interpolating the production for all years, according the provided production estimates for selected years, using exponential fit.

# ### overall mass associated with civil engineering earthworks, dredging and waste/overburden from metal and mineral production 
# 
# To calculate the mass excavated/moved, we sum the four contributions: dredging, civil engineering earthworks, waste/ overburden resulted from mineral/metal and coal production.  

# In[34]:


excavations = np.array(list(dredging.iloc[:77,1])) + np.array(list(coal_over.iloc[:77,1])) + np.array(list(earthwork[:77])) + np.array(list(m_over.iloc[:,1]))
