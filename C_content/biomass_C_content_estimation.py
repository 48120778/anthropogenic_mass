# # Biomass C content estimation
# 
# Biomass is presented in the paper on a dry-weight basis. As part of the biomass calculation, we converted biomass in carbon-weight basis to dry-weight basis by multiplying by a conversion factor. 
# 
# ## Conversion factor calculation  
# 
# The conversion factor was calculated based on C content estimates of the different plant compartments (leaves, stems and roots) of different biomes, from [Tang et al.](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1700295114) (units: (mg/g)). 

# In[2]:


# Upload C content data from Tang et al., units [mg/g]
c_content = pd.read_excel("C_content_Tang.xlsx")

# Save parameters to unumpy arrays 
cleaf = unumpy.uarray(list(c_content['leaf']), list(c_content['leaf std']))
cstem = unumpy.uarray(list(c_content['stem'].fillna(0)), list(c_content['stem std'].fillna(0)))
croot = unumpy.uarray(list(c_content['root']), list(c_content['root std']))


# For each biome, we calculate the weighted average C content according to the mass fraction of each plant compartment. Information on plants compartmental mass composition was obtained from [Poorter et al.](https://nph.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1469-8137.2011.03952.x).

# Calculate the weighted average for each biome

# Next, we calculate the plants conversion factor, according to the mass fraction of each biome, which was calculated by the corresponding mass of each of the biome categories, derived from [Erb et al.](https://doi.org/10.1038/nature25138).

# In the overall carbon-weight to dry-weight conversion factor, we also accounted the C content of non-plant biomass, which was based on estimates from [Heldal et al.](https://aem.asm.org/content/50/5/1251.short) and [von Stockar](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0005272899000651). We used the current estimate of non-plant biomass fraction - about 10% of the total biomass, according to [Bar-On et al.](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1711842115) and [updates](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41561-018-0221-6).
